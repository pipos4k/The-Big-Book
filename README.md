# The Big Book

This is a combination of little problems which I solved using Python.

reference: The Big Book from Al Sweigart

I use folders for each project, in case I need to work with classes or something else.

I skipped the fifth project because it was a bouncing DVD logo GUI. Maybe Iâ€™ll do it in the future.
